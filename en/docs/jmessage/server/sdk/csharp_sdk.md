## FAQ

1. If there is a deadlock when calling the asynchronous method, ie HttpResponse has not been returned, please refer to [this article](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/jpsanders/2017/08/28/asp-net-do-not-use-task-result-in-main-context/).

2. Because HttpClient is used, the current library does not support .NET Framework 4.0 or below. Therefore, if they are these versions, it is recommended to use the [v1 version](https://github.com/jpush/jmessage-api-csharp-client/tree/v1) of the library.
